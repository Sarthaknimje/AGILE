## Problem Statement

Strategic Portfolio Management (SPM) organizations face significant challenges in making data-driven decisions due to:

- **Complex Risk Assessment**: Manual portfolio risk evaluation is time-consuming and prone to human bias
- **Limited Predictive Capabilities**: Traditional methods lack sophisticated forecasting for portfolio performance
- **Fragmented Data Sources**: Disconnected systems make it difficult to consolidate portfolio insights
- **Real-time Decision Making**: Delayed analytics prevent timely strategic adjustments
- **Scalability Issues**: Growing portfolio complexity requires automated ML-driven solutions

The need for an agile, iterative approach to implement machine learning solutions that can adapt to changing business requirements and continuously improve portfolio management capabilities.
